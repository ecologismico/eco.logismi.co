Environment is a broad, interdisciplinary field, and both natural process modelling and decision support for environmental management require a significant investment from software engineers to understand the domain, while raise new research challenges. Environmental applications are not only data-intense and complex, but also inherit from natural systems problems of uncertainty and scaling, which altogether comprise the key challenges of ecoinformatics research.<\/p>\n<p>This talk provides a gentle introduction to ecoinformatics, i.e. the science of information in ecology and environmental sciences, by presenting key concepts and research challenges.
