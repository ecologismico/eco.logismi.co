In recent years, activities such as the Semantic Web have created a renewed interest for evolving unstructured \u201cmetadata\u201d into more formal and accurate description of the datasets used in natural sciences and management. Conceptualizations (ontologies) that can help formalizing scientific observations and the ways the observed parts of a system relate to each other have multiplied as their role becomes more important. Such products allow basic integration of independently collected information and provide a branching point for further specification with domain-specific ontologies, enabling semantic validation of the information collected, transferred and created along data paths.<br \/>\n<em id=\"__mceDel\"><br \/>\n<\/em>In this address, Prof. Villa takes a step towards a higher-level generalization and present a new modeling language aimed to enable multiple-scale, multiple-paradigm, and modular description of systems. The language is based on a formal definition of what scientific observations are, and presents &#8220;models&#8221; as strategies to observe abstract concepts and produce data that describe them, harmonizing potentially different views of time and space. This formalism, called semantic meta-modeling, offers a uniform and cohesive approach that encompasses data management, storage, querying and many aspects of traditional modeling.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><b>About the Speaker:<br \/>\n<\/b><strong>Ferdinando Villa<\/strong> holds a Ph.D. in theoretical Ecology and had a long parallel career as a scientific software designer and engineer. After working in many fields of Ecology, from theoretical island biogeography to spatially-explicit\u00a0decision analysis, he discovered the joys and pains of interdisciplinary research during a 14-year career in ecological economics at the universities of Maryland and Vermont. He still finds it a challenge (and a responsibility) to\u00a0maintain scientific depth unaltered in face of the greatly increased breadth. He has since expanded the focus of his research to the interface of policy, ecology and economics, concentrating on artificial intelligence approaches to assist\u00a0environmental decision making and natural system assessment and valuation.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div>Dr. Villa best known project is ARIES (Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ariesonline.org\/\">http:\/\/www.ariesonline.org<\/a>), which is producing \u00a0a next-generation web application meant to make environmental decisions easier and more effective.\u00a0The ARIES project builds on a partnership of international experts, NGOs, and academics, and pairs user and expert knowledge with advanced artificial intelligence to construct a model of a case study, making sure that no relevant\u00a0data or knowledge is overlooked.\u00a0He has been the recipient of several million USD in research grants from the US National Science Foundation, the European Union, UNEP-WCMC and other institutions and NGOs, to contribute to the science of\u00a0coupled natural\/human systems and develop tools for decision makers that integrate the best science with IT-assisted decision tools.
