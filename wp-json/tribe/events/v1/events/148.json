AgMIP is a networking program for impacts of climate change on food security in particular in relation to crop production and economic effects. SemAgrow is an EU FP7 research project focusing on the application of semantic technologies and specifically semantic querying of big data to the agricultural domain.<br \/>\nSecondary aims are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To get to know and learn from each others research plans, as also MACSUR representatives will be participating. MACSUR is in many ways similar to AgMIP and it has only European partners<\/li>\n<li>To explore appropriate data management solutions (based on semantic technologies) for agricultural research focused on food security.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Approach to the workshop: the first day is geared to bringing all participants on the same knowledge level with respect to the different initiatives and technologies, so will be more presentation and informative discussion focused. The second day goes more in depth on what could be done for AgMIP from the technologies part of SemaGrow, and will focus on more discussion and joint exploration.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"semagrow-workshop","image":false,"all_day":true,"start_date":"2013-06-17 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2013","month":"06","day":"17","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2013-06-18 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2013","month":"06","day":"18","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":null,"utc_start_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":null,"utc_end_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"","values":[]},"website":"http:\/\/eco.logismi.co\/event\/semagrow-workshop\/","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"AgMIP","slug":"agmip","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":8,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":8,"filter":"raw","id":8,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/eco.logismi.co\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/8","collection":"http:\/\/eco.logismi.co\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}},{"name":"Workshops","slug":"workshops","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":7,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":11,"filter":"raw","id":7,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/eco.logismi.co\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/7","collection":"http:\/\/eco.logismi.co\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":151,"author":"1","status":"draft","date":"2013-06-18 17:39:08","date_utc":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"2013-06-18 17:39:08","modified_utc":"2013-06-18 14:39:08","url":"http:\/\/eco.logismi.co\/?post_type=tribe_venue&p=151","venue":"Alterra, Wageningen University","city":"Wageningen","country":"Netherlands","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Alterra, Wageningen University","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressLocality":"Wageningen","addressCountry":"Netherlands"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"eco.logismi.co?id=151","global_id_lineage":["eco.logismi.co?id=151"]},"organizer":[{"id":150,"author":"1","status":"draft","date":"2013-06-18 17:39:08","date_utc":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"2013-06-18 17:39:08","modified_utc":"2013-06-18 14:39:08","url":"http:\/\/eco.logismi.co\/?post_type=tribe_organizer&p=150","organizer":"Sander Janssen","website":"http:\/\/www.wageningenur.nl\/en\/Expertise-Services\/Research-Institutes\/alterra\/About-Alterra\/Teams-Alterra\/Earth-observation.htm","json_ld":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sander Janssen","description":"","url":false,"telephone":"","email":"","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.wageningenur.nl\/en\/Expertise-Services\/Research-Institutes\/alterra\/About-Alterra\/Teams-Alterra\/Earth-observation.htm"},"global_id":"eco.logismi.co?id=150","global_id_lineage":["eco.logismi.co?id=150"]}],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"First AgMIP-Semagrow Workshop: use cases for advanced data management based on semantic technologies","description":"&lt;p&gt;The first AgMIP-Semagrow Workshop aims to further develop use cases for Semgrow based on AgMIP problems of data management and modelling.
