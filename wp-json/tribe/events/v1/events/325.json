Tools and models provide researchers and planners with the ability to improve the management of the water resources. In Africa, this capacity for assessment and planning are becoming all the more critical with increased demands on water from agriculture, industry and a growing population, as well as concerns over potential impact of climate change, declining water quality, and environmental impact of commercial farming and urbanization. However, most African researcher institutions and development implementing agencies and organizations are unable to access many of the tools available that would enable them to conduct effective research for analysis and planning. In addition, the capacity to use existing tools is also low. At the same time, new tools are being developed to be accessible to all \u2013 open source tools. While this offers promise for users in Africa, these users remain largely disconnected from developers. The disconnects is leading to a lack of awareness of tools available, continued low capacity on how to use the tools, and at times, mismatch between the tools developed and what is needed to optimise the use of water in relation to environmental protection, food security, energy protections and many other demands. By organising the 3rd OpenWater symposium in Africa, we hope to highlight models and tools that are overcoming existing gaps in water management, such as with gender and nutrition balances.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/eco.logismi.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2014\/11\/OpenWater2015-symposium_flyer.pdf\">For more see the OpenWater2015 Flyer<\/a><\/p>","excerpt":"<p>The OpenWater symposium aims at sharing experiences in Africa, tools, training materials and model codes applicable in the water domain.
